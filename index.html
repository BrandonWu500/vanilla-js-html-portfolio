          <p>
            I recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor
            of Science Degree in Computer Science. I have been interested in web
            development for over a year now, specifically the front-end. I have
            been learning through a combination of college courses and
            self-learning by reading Mozilla guides and documentation, along
            with watching YouTube tutorials.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have
            experience with ReactJS and many of its associated libraries
            including React Redux, React Router, and Redux Toolkit. I am also
            comfortable using React Hooks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am trying to gain more experience with the MERN Stack
            by building more projects. I am also trying to get more comfortable
            using TypeScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I also have experience with Sass (or SCSS syntax),
            styled-components, Material UI, Tailwind CSS, and Responsive Web
            Design.
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold">
            Right now, I am actively looking for a job as a front-end developer
            or React developer.

            <p>
              Before attempting this project, I had already done a few projects
              with React and a group project with the MERN Stack. However, I
              hadn't really done a big project by myself with the MERN Stack. I
              decided on the idea of a shopping website because it was something
              I had used myself before, and I could reference those websites
              that I had used when building the project (like Amazon for
              example). A shopping website also has a variety of different
              features that could help me practice my skills with React,
              specifically with managing state changes in multiple places (by
              using Redux Toolkit). It would also provide me an opportunity to
              utilize multiple models in MongoDB, but be common enough that
              there would be documentation or examples out there to guide me if
              I got stuck on the logic of a controller.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of actually building the project, I started off by
              building a mobile-responsive frontend using React, Redux Toolkit
              and styled-components. I already had experience with all of these
              technologies, and I thought the familiarity I had would make it
              easier as a starting point. It would also give me insight as to
              what models and controllers that I would need in the backend.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the big problems I ran into when building the frontend was
              figuring out how I was going to handle different requests based on
              whether they were a logged-in user or a guest user. I thought it
              was important to handle this distinction because most shopping
              websites don't require you to make an account to make an order.
              However, this was my first time handling this type of distinction
              in a project, so it took me a bit of trial and error.
            </p>
            <p>
              At first, I tried using the same functions in Redux Toolkit and
              just changing the logic based on whether they were a user or a
              guest. I thought I would have to do this because I needed to save
              the cart regardless of whether they were signed in or not.
              However, after trying it out, I realized that it was impractical
              to save a guest's cart in the database because they wouldn't have
              a user id. Next, I thought about just having a guest user id in
              the database, but I realized that this solution could potentially
              run into problems if I ended up allowing users to save multiple
              carts (like a wishlist cart for example). Finally, I decided to
              use localStorage to save the guest's cart. This way the guest's
              cart could be saved to the browser, and I made it so if they
              logged in as a user it would clear the localStorage cart. Also,
              since I ended up using localStorage as opposed to the database, I
              had to use a different set of reducers in the redux because I no
              longer needed to make axios requests to the database for a guest.
              For the logged-in user requests to the database, I used the
              extraReducers feature in Redux Toolkit, which let me specifically
              target the pending, fulfilled, and rejected states resulting from
              the promises returned by the axios requests.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was how I ended up setting up my reducers in redux toolkit to
              handle changes to the guest cart:
            </p>
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/mern-shop/mern-shop-guest-redux.png"
              alt=""
              class="mb-8"
            />
            <p>
              This was how I ended up using the extraReducers in redux toolkit
              to handle the changes to the user's cart:
            </p>
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/mern-shop/mern-shop-user-redux.png"
              alt=""
              class="mb-8"
            />
            <p>
              This was how I ended up setting up my functions to make requests
              to the backend api with redux toolkit:
            </p>
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/mern-shop/mern-shop-cart-service.png"
              alt=""
              class="mb-8"
            />
            <p>
              After building the frontend, I determined that I would need four
              different models in the backend: users, carts, orders, and
              products. Each of those models would have their respective routes
              and controllers. However, additionally I needed routes and
              controller logic to handle the checkout process. I used Stripe to
              help with the payments because it was a popular choice and seemed
              straightforward to use.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had helped build a backend in the past using MongoDB, Express,
              and NodeJS. However, this was my first time building a backend,
              with multiple models, on my own using these technologies. I
              started off just setting up the routes and models with basic
              controller logic just to see if everything was working. I used
              Postman to test my api endpoints along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the biggest challenges I ran into when building the backend
              was setting up the models properly with the right properties. This
              was especially apparent in the products schema. At first, I
              thought I could set the color and size properties to an array of
              strings, similar to the categories property. This worked fine when
              rendering the different options on the product info page. However,
              as I was testing the add to cart process, I realized that products
              with the same title and different colors or sizes were being
              treated as the same product in the cart. This meant that the user
              couldn't view or update their choices separately based on the
              different color or size of the product. Another problem was the
              image being rendered was always the same, regardless of the color.
              To remedy this, I decided to change the color and size properties
              in the schema to be an array of objects instead and give a
              separate product id to each color and size.
            </p>
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/mern-shop/product-schema.png"
              alt=""
              class="object-contain h-96"
            />
            <p>
              This did end up working out where the different colors and sizes
              were being rendered separately in the cart, which allowed the user
              to update the items without affecting others with the same title.
              However, after completing the project and analyzing the code, I
              realized that it would have been a lot simpler to save the color
              and size properties as strings. Then, have a separate product id
              for each color and size. Finally, when rendering the product info,
              doing a lookup in the database based on the title of the product
              rather than the id.
            </p>
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/mern-shop/product-controller.png"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              Overall, it was fun building this project and I learned a lot! I
              had been learning a few of the technologies I used in this project
              separately, but building this project gave me more experience
              putting them all together. I am still definitely more comfortable
              with the frontend, but I do feel more familiar with the backend
              now. As I was building the backend, it also gave me more ideas to
              add to the frontend, along with improving the existing features.
            </p>
            <p>
              After building this project, the next idea I have is to build an
              admin dashboard using the MERN Stack to make it easier and more
              efficient to handle the backend for the shopping app. The admin
              dashboard could also be used in future projects besides just the
              shopping app.

            <p>
              This project is a mock frontend for an admin dashboard. It uses
              React with TypeScript along with Sass.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to build this project as a continuation of the
              e-commerce app that I built previously. The goal was to make it
              easier for an admin to access user and product data and make
              changes accordingly. I also wanted to gain more experience with
              TypeScript and Sass, so I thought this would be a good opportunity
              for that.
            </p>
            <h5>TypeScript:</h5>
            <p>
              Before going into the project, I knew that TypeScript was similar
              to JavaScript, it just meant adding explicit types to variables to
              make it easier to read and understand the code. However, I didn't
              anticipate some of the challenges I would face when writing my
              normal React code.
            </p>
            <p>
              It turns out TypeScript didn't agree with some of the ways I had
              initially gone about writing the code. I had to re-think and
              re-write different portions of my code throughout the process to
              avoid running into TypeScript errors.
            </p>
            <p>
              One example of this was when implementing the dark mode feature
              and using the react context api along with the useReducer hook. I
              wanted to pass the dark mode state along with the dispatch
              function to the sidebar and topbar where users would have the
              option of choosing a color theme or just directly toggling dark
              mode on and off as seen in the ui here:
            </p>
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/dark-mode-ui-buttons.png"
              alt=""
              class="mb-8"
            />
            <p>I was going to accomplish this by writing the code like this:</p>
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/dark-mode-context-before.png"
              alt=""
              class="mb-8"
            />
            <p>
              However, I ran into some typescript errors so I ended up creating
              a custom hook and passing that to the context provider value
              instead.
            </p>
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/dark-mode-context-after-1.png"
              alt=""
            />
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/dark-mode-context-after-2.png"
              alt=""
              class="mb-8"
            />

            <p>
              Another problem I ran into was figuring out the right type names
              for some of the variables I used. I knew I could use the “any”
              type to skirt around some of the errors, but it wasn't the best
              practice to do that because then it would defeat the purpose of
              using TypeScript, so I tried to keep my “any” usage to a minimum
              and also use the vscode intellisense to help me determine what
              type to use in what situation.
            </p>
            <h5>Sass (SCSS syntax):</h5>
            <p>
              This was my first time using Sass in a larger project, but I
              didn't think it would be too difficult to pick up because I was
              confident in my CSS skills and using custom properties.
              Additionally, I had experience with styled-components, which also
              used nested rulesets.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the most part, I didn't have any problems with Sass during the
              project. However, one misconception I did have was that the
              stylesheets would work like styled-components. I thought they
              would be specific to the page or component I was working on.
            </p>
            <p>
              For instance, with styled-components I could reuse “class” names
              like “container” and “title” without it affecting other components
              with the same name on other pages.
            </p>
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/styled-components-comparison.png"
              alt=""
              class="mb-8 max-h-64 object-cover object-top"
            />
            <p>
              However, with Sass, I quickly realized that wasn't the case, so I
              decided to wrap the component or page I was working on in a div
              with a unique class name corresponding to the file name. This way
              I could nest all the rulesets within that unique wrapper div and
              not have to worry about reusing names affecting other components.
            </p>
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/sass-comparison.png"
              alt=""
              class="mb-8"
            />
            <p>
              Another unique thing I learned about Sass that I actually quite
              enjoyed using was mix-ins. Mix-ins are similar to functions in
              Sass except they don't have a return value and instead allow you
              to change rulesets accordingly. This was useful when setting an
              element's background color in relation to its color, as well as
              implementing a responsive design for multiple different devices
              (mobile, tablet, laptop).
            </p>
            <img src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/mixin-1.png" alt="" />
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/mixin-2.png"
              alt=""
              class="mb-8 max-h-96 object-contain"
            />
            <p>
              Finally, I also experimented with using loops in Sass, which ended
              up allowing me to reproduce class names similar to Tailwind CSS,
              with regard to customizing specific property values like gap.
            </p>
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/sass-loops.png"
              alt=""
              class="mb-8"
            />
            <h5>Things I'm Proud of:</h5>
            <p>
              The last thing I want to share is just a few code snippets from
              the project that I'm proud of.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first was creating my own data table component similar to the
              one used by Material UI. I used an html table and then used enum
              values to sort the different columns when the headers were
              clicked, along with adding an arrow hover effect so a user could
              clearly tell what clicking on the headers would do.
            </p>
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/data-table-ui.png"
              alt=""
            />
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/data-table-code.png"
              alt=""
              class="mb-8"
            />
            <p>
              The second was figuring out how to use a single React ref object
              to store multiple inputs or textareas fields and then use those
              refs to edit and save user info accordingly.
            </p>
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/user-card-ui.png"
              alt=""
              class="mb-8 max-h-96 object-contain"
            />
            <img src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/user-card.png" alt="" />
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/user-card-row.png"
              alt=""
              class="mb-8"
            />
            <p>
              At a first glance it doesn't seem like much code or that
              difficult, but the reason why I got stuck on this part was because
              I kept running into TypeScript errors or the refs wouldn't update
              their respective input field. However, after reading some stack
              overflow posts and a little trial and error, I managed to get it
              to work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using those refs, I also was able to create two different ways to
              edit user info. One way was directly in the user info card, and
              one was with a fullscreen popup and overlay.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/alt-edit-ui.png" alt="" />
            <img
              src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/alternative-edit.png"
              alt=""
              class="mb-8"
            />
            <p>
              Overall, this was a fun project to learn TypeScript and Sass,
              while also giving me the chance to utilize a wider variety of
              React hooks. It was also nice to be able to build off one of my
              previous project ideas. At the same time, the layout I built could
              still be used for a non-ecommerce admin dashboard.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the next installment of the project, my initial plan was to use
              the backend from the MERN shopping site and connect it with the
              frontend of the admin dashboard to allow me to work with dynamic
              data instead of dummy data. However, I have now decided to use
              Google Firebase instead because it will give me a chance to be
              exposed to a new backend technology. Additionally, Firebase seems
              to have less setup and maintenance involved compared to a MERN
              stack app at the cost of less freedom and customizability.
              However, since I want to focus on frontend web development, that's
              okay for my purposes.
