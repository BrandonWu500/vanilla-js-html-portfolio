            About Me
          </h2>
          <p>
            I recently graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor
            of Science Degree in Computer Science. I have been interested in web
            development for over a year now, specifically the front-end. I have
            been learning through a combination of college courses and
            self-learning by reading Mozilla guides and documentation, along
            with watching YouTube tutorials.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have
            experience with ReactJS and many of its associated libraries
            including React Redux, React Router, and Redux Toolkit. I am also
            comfortable using React Hooks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am trying to gain more experience with the MERN Stack
            by building more projects. I am also trying to get more comfortable
            using TypeScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I also have experience with Sass (or SCSS syntax),
            styled-components, Material UI, Tailwind CSS, and Responsive Web
            Design.
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold">
            Right now, I am actively looking for a job as a front-end developer
            or React developer.

              <p>
                Before attempting this project, I had already done a few
                projects with React and a group project with the MERN Stack.
                However, I hadn't really done a big project by myself with the
                MERN Stack. I decided on the idea of a shopping website because
                it was something I had used myself before, and I could reference
                those websites that I had used when building the project (like
                Amazon for example). A shopping website also has a variety of
                different features that could help me practice my skills with
                React, specifically with managing state changes in multiple
                places (by using Redux Toolkit). It would also provide me an
                opportunity to utilize multiple models in MongoDB, but be common
                enough that there would be documentation or examples out there
                to guide me if I got stuck on the logic of a controller.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of actually building the project, I started off by
                building a mobile-responsive frontend using React, Redux Toolkit
                and styled-components. I already had experience with all of
                these technologies, and I thought the familiarity I had would
                make it easier as a starting point. It would also give me
                insight as to what models and controllers that I would need in
                the backend.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the big problems I ran into when building the frontend
                was figuring out how I was going to handle different requests
                based on whether they were a logged-in user or a guest user. I
                thought it was important to handle this distinction because most
                shopping websites don't require you to make an account to make
                an order. However, this was my first time handling this type of
                distinction in a project, so it took me a bit of trial and
                error.
              </p>
              <p>
                At first, I tried using the same functions in Redux Toolkit and
                just changing the logic based on whether they were a user or a
                guest. I thought I would have to do this because I needed to
                save the cart regardless of whether they were signed in or not.
                However, after trying it out, I realized that it was impractical
                to save a guest's cart in the database because they wouldn't
                have a user id. Next, I thought about just having a guest user
                id in the database, but I realized that this solution could
                potentially run into problems if I ended up allowing users to
                save multiple carts (like a wishlist cart for example). Finally,
                I decided to use localStorage to save the guest's cart. This way
                the guest's cart could be saved to the browser, and I made it so
                if they logged in as a user it would clear the localStorage
                cart. Also, since I ended up using localStorage as opposed to
                the database, I had to use a different set of reducers in the
                redux because I no longer needed to make axios requests to the
                database for a guest. For the logged-in user requests to the
                database, I used the extraReducers feature in Redux Toolkit,
                which let me specifically target the pending, fulfilled, and
                rejected states resulting from the promises returned by the
                axios requests.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was how I ended up setting up my reducers in redux toolkit
                to handle changes to the guest cart:
              </p>
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/mern-shop/mern-shop-guest-redux.png"
                alt=""
                class="mb-8"
              />
              <p>
                This was how I ended up using the extraReducers in redux toolkit
                to handle the changes to the user's cart:
              </p>
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/mern-shop/mern-shop-user-redux.png"
                alt=""
                class="mb-8"
              />
              <p>
                This was how I ended up setting up my functions to make requests
                to the backend api with redux toolkit:
              </p>
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/mern-shop/mern-shop-cart-service.png"
                alt=""
                class="mb-8"
              />
              <p>
                After building the frontend, I determined that I would need four
                different models in the backend: users, carts, orders, and
                products. Each of those models would have their respective
                routes and controllers. However, additionally I needed routes
                and controller logic to handle the checkout process. I used
                Stripe to help with the payments because it was a popular choice
                and seemed straightforward to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had helped build a backend in the past using MongoDB, Express,
                and NodeJS. However, this was my first time building a backend,
                with multiple models, on my own using these technologies. I
                started off just setting up the routes and models with basic
                controller logic just to see if everything was working. I used
                Postman to test my api endpoints along the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the biggest challenges I ran into when building the
                backend was setting up the models properly with the right
                properties. This was especially apparent in the products schema.
                At first, I thought I could set the color and size properties to
                an array of strings, similar to the categories property. This
                worked fine when rendering the different options on the product
                info page. However, as I was testing the add to cart process, I
                realized that products with the same title and different colors
                or sizes were being treated as the same product in the cart.
                This meant that the user couldn't view or update their choices
                separately based on the different color or size of the product.
                Another problem was the image being rendered was always the
                same, regardless of the color. To remedy this, I decided to
                change the color and size properties in the schema to be an
                array of objects instead and give a separate product id to each
                color and size.
              </p>
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/mern-shop/product-schema.png"
                alt=""
                class="object-contain h-96"
              />
              <p>
                This did end up working out where the different colors and sizes
                were being rendered separately in the cart, which allowed the
                user to update the items without affecting others with the same
                title. However, after completing the project and analyzing the
                code, I realized that it would have been a lot simpler to save
                the color and size properties as strings. Then, have a separate
                product id for each color and size. Finally, when rendering the
                product info, doing a lookup in the database based on the title
                of the product rather than the id.
              </p>

                Overall, it was fun building this project and I learned a lot! I
                had been learning a few of the technologies I used in this
                project separately, but building this project gave me more
                experience putting them all together. I am still definitely more
                comfortable with the frontend, but I do feel more familiar with
                the backend now. As I was building the backend, it also gave me
                more ideas to add to the frontend, along with improving the
                existing features.
              </p>
              <p>
                After building this project, the next idea I have is to build an
                admin dashboard using the MERN Stack to make it easier and more
                efficient to handle the backend for the shopping app. The admin
                dashboard could also be used in future projects besides just the
                shopping app.

              <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-8">Case Study:</h4>
              <p>
                This project is a mock frontend for an admin dashboard. It uses
                React with TypeScript along with Sass.
              </p>
              <p>
                I decided to build this project as a continuation of the
                e-commerce app that I built previously. The goal was to make it
                easier for an admin to access user and product data and make
                changes accordingly. I also wanted to gain more experience with
                TypeScript and Sass, so I thought this would be a good
                opportunity for that.
              </p>
              <div>
                <h5 class="font-bold">TypeScript:</h5>
                <p>
                  Before going into the project, I knew that TypeScript was
                  similar to JavaScript, it just meant adding explicit types to
                  variables to make it easier to read and understand the code.
                  However, I didn't anticipate some of the challenges I would
                  face when writing my normal React code.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                It turns out TypeScript didn't agree with some of the ways I had
                initially gone about writing the code. I had to re-think and
                re-write different portions of my code throughout the process to
                avoid running into TypeScript errors.
              </p>
              <p>
                One example of this was when implementing the dark mode feature
                and using the react context api along with the useReducer hook.
                I wanted to pass the dark mode state along with the dispatch
                function to the sidebar and topbar where users would have the
                option of choosing a color theme or just directly toggling dark
                mode on and off as seen in the ui here:
              </p>
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/dark-mode-ui-buttons.png"
                alt=""
                class="mb-8"
              />
              <p>
                I was going to accomplish this by writing the code like this:
              </p>
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/dark-mode-context-before.png"
                alt=""
                class="mb-8"
              />
              <p>
                However, I ran into some typescript errors so I ended up
                creating a custom hook and passing that to the context provider
                value instead.
              </p>
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/dark-mode-context-after-1.png"
                alt=""
              />
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/dark-mode-context-after-2.png"
                alt=""
                class="mb-8"
              />

              <p>
                Another problem I ran into was figuring out the right type names
                for some of the variables I used. I knew I could use the “any”
                type to skirt around some of the errors, but it wasn't the best
                practice to do that because then it would defeat the purpose of
                using TypeScript, so I tried to keep my “any” usage to a minimum
                and also use the vscode intellisense to help me determine what
                type to use in what situation.
              </p>
              <div>
                <h5 class="font-bold">Sass (SCSS syntax):</h5>
                <p>
                  This was my first time using Sass in a larger project, but I
                  didn't think it would be too difficult to pick up because I
                  was confident in my CSS skills and using custom properties.
                  Additionally, I had experience with styled-components, which
                  also used nested rulesets.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                For the most part, I didn't have any problems with Sass during
                the project. However, one misconception I did have was that the
                stylesheets would work like styled-components. I thought they
                would be specific to the page or component I was working on.
              </p>
              <p>
                For instance, with styled-components I could reuse “class” names
                like “container” and “title” without it affecting other
                components with the same name on other pages.
              </p>
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/styled-components-comparison.png"
                alt=""
                class="mb-8 max-h-64 object-cover object-top"
              />
              <p>
                However, with Sass, I quickly realized that wasn't the case, so
                I decided to wrap the component or page I was working on in a
                div with a unique class name corresponding to the file name.
                This way I could nest all the rulesets within that unique
                wrapper div and not have to worry about reusing names affecting
                other components.
              </p>
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/sass-comparison.png"
                alt=""
                class="mb-8"
              />
              <p>
                Another unique thing I learned about Sass that I actually quite
                enjoyed using was mix-ins. Mix-ins are similar to functions in
                Sass except they don't have a return value and instead allow you
                to change rulesets accordingly. This was useful when setting an
                element's background color in relation to its color, as well as
                implementing a responsive design for multiple different devices
                (mobile, tablet, laptop).
              </p>
              <img src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/mixin-1.png" alt="" />
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/mixin-2.png"
                alt=""
                class="mb-8 max-h-96 object-contain"
              />
              <p>
                Finally, I also experimented with using loops in Sass, which
                ended up allowing me to reproduce class names similar to
                Tailwind CSS, with regard to customizing specific property
                values like gap.
              </p>

                class="mb-8"
              />
              <div>
                <h5 class="font-bold">Things I'm Proud of:</h5>
                <p>
                  The last thing I want to share is just a few code snippets
                  from the project that I'm proud of.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                The first was creating my own data table component similar to
                the one used by Material UI. I used an html table and then used
                enum values to sort the different columns when the headers were
                clicked, along with adding an arrow hover effect so a user could
                clearly tell what clicking on the headers would do.
              </p>
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/data-table-ui.png"
                alt=""
              />
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/data-table-code.png"
                alt=""
                class="mb-8"
              />
              <p>
                The second was figuring out how to use a single React ref object
                to store multiple inputs or textareas fields and then use those
                refs to edit and save user info accordingly.
              </p>
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/user-card-ui.png"
                alt=""
                class="mb-8 max-h-96 object-contain"
              />
              <img src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/user-card.png" alt="" />
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/user-card-row.png"
                alt=""
                class="mb-8"
              />
              <p>
                At a first glance it doesn't seem like much code or that
                difficult, but the reason why I got stuck on this part was
                because I kept running into TypeScript errors or the refs
                wouldn't update their respective input field. However, after
                reading some stack overflow posts and a little trial and error,
                I managed to get it to work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using those refs, I also was able to create two different ways
                to edit user info. One way was directly in the user info card,
                and one was with a fullscreen popup and overlay.
              </p>
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/admin-front/alt-edit-ui.png"

              <img

                alt=""
                class="mb-8"
              />
              <p>
                Overall, this was a fun project to learn TypeScript and Sass,
                while also giving me the chance to utilize a wider variety of
                React hooks. It was also nice to be able to build off one of my
                previous project ideas. At the same time, the layout I built
                could still be used for a non-ecommerce admin dashboard.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the next installment of the project, my initial plan was to
                use the backend from the MERN shopping site and connect it with
                the frontend of the admin dashboard to allow me to work with
                dynamic data instead of dummy data. However, I have now decided
                to use Google Firebase instead because it will give me a chance
                to be exposed to a new backend technology. Additionally,
                Firebase seems to have less setup and maintenance involved
                compared to a MERN stack app at the cost of less freedom and
                customizability. However, since I want to focus on frontend web
                development, that's okay for my purposes.

              <p>
                This project is a continuation of the admin dashboard frontend.
                It uses Google Firebase as a backend to provide dynamic data for
                users, products, and orders. It also adds a third color theme
                option (blue).
              </p>
              <div>
                <h5 class="font-bold">Firebase:</h5>
                <p>
                  This was my first time using Firebase. However, I did have
                  previous experience with MongoDB, which is also a NoSQL
                  database, so that definitely helped me pick it up faster. I
                  knew how to structure my code to make the CRUD operations, I
                  just had to learn the exact syntax used by Firebase.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 class="font-bold">What I liked:</h5>
                <p>
                  One cool thing about Firebase is that I could directly use it
                  in my React code. I didn’t have to set up a backend with
                  NodeJS and Express. All that was needed was the firebase
                  config file.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                Another cool feature I liked about Firebase was being able to
                work with realtime data easily.
              </p>
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/admin-firebase/realtime-data.png"
                alt=""
                class="mb-8"
              />
              <p>
                Using the code shown above, I was able to set up a listener that
                constantly checked for updates to the data collection. So, if I
                was on the data table page, and I made a change to the data on
                the firebase site, it would immediately update the data table

                <h5 class="font-bold">Firebase Challenges:</h5>
                <p>
                  One of the main challenges I ran into when using Firebase was
                  when I was trying to implement the file upload feature on the
                  edit user info page. Using the boilerplate code they had in
                  the documentation, I was able to get the image preview option
                  to work. Thus, I had no problems with the add user/item
                  option, or so I thought. However, when it came time to test
                  the edit user option, after hitting the save button, I
                  realized that sometimes the image updated correctly, and
                  sometimes it reverted back to the old image. I monitored the
                  upload progress and it showed 100% every time, but still, it
                  didn’t save properly every time. I was so confused!
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                However, after a few console.logs in the handleSave function, I
                realized that the img url wasn’t being updated sometimes after
                the uploadFile function was called. After examining the
                boilerplate code more carefully, I realized the mistake I had
                made. All the way at the bottom, where I was updating the info
                to hold the new image url, I noticed the getDownloadURL function
                returned a promise. When the image url wasn’t updating properly,
                that promise must not have been resolved yet. I tested my theory
                by hitting the save button as soon as possible vs. waiting 5
                seconds. Sure enough, when I waited 5 seconds every time the
                image updated properly. My mistake had been only taking into
                consideration the image upload progress, and forgetting about
                the time it took to get the download url after. I fixed the
                problem by adding a separate useState hook that tracked the
                getDownloadUrl progress and returned true only after the image
                url had been updated properly.

                <h5 class="font-bold">Dynamic Data Changes:</h5>
                <p>
                  Now, I want to talk about two of the big changes I made by
                  working with dynamic data instead of the static mock data.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                Since I was making async requests to firebase now, I had to add
                loading text to the different components that fetched data.
                Without it, a user with slow internet connection could open up a
                page and see no items found when in reality the data was still
                being fetched.
              </p>
              <p>
                For most of the components, this wasn’t a problem. However, in
                the data table component I ran into an issue when there was
                actually no data in the collection. Originally, I had it that
                when data was fetched it would set isLoading to false, but since
                I was using a real time listener, it would just keep fetching
                and never show “no items found”. The way I got around this was
                by adding a check to see if the data array being returned had a
                length of 0, and changing the title and isLoading variable
                accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, the problem with that approach was that it would
                now set isLoading to false before the data had even begun to
                fetch because the initial array in the useState had a length of
                0.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, I decided to use a setTimeout function and after a
                certain period of time, only then would it set isLoading to
                false. The setTimeout was only called in the event that the data
                array had a length of 0. This meant that if there was data in
                the collection, the loading text would properly show up before
                the data was loaded. However, if there was no data, the loading
                text would stay on the screen for the duration of the timeout
                before showing “no items found”.

              />

                loop
                muted
                autoplay
                class="mb-8"
              ></video>
              <p>No Data in Collection:</p>
              <video
                src="/images/screenshots/admin-firebase/realtime-no-data-load-480.mp4"
                loop
                muted
                autoplay
                class="mb-8"
              ></video>
              <p>
                The second big change I had to account for was the changing
                order of headers in the data table as well as the input fields
                in the edit info component. What I mean by this is that because
                I was now fetching document fields in each collection and using
                Object.keys() to map them out, the order would change every time
                I reloaded the page. I wasn’t quite sure how to sort them in the
                same order every time, but after searching on stack overflow, I
                found a simple solution that works well.
              </p>
              <img
                src="/images/screenshots/admin-firebase/fixed-order-datatable-headers.png"
                alt=""
                class="mb-8"
              />
              <p>
                Also as shown above, specifically for the data table page, I
                wanted to store the name and image of the item under one column,
                so I first filtered out the name and image fields from the
                object and then used the spread operator in combination with the
                slice() method to add that column name in a fixed position every
                time.
              </p>
              <div>
                <h5 class="font-bold">Third color theme:</h5>
                <p>
                  The last thing I want to touch on is the third color theme
                  option that I promised I would implement with this iteration
                  of the project. Last time, with the useContext and useReducer
                  hooks I was able to create a light and dark mode. I had done
                  this by toggling a boolean state variable.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                However, in order to add the third color theme (blue), I ended
                up changing that state variable to a string and using that to
                add a class name to the global app. Most of the work for this
                part of the project actually was refactoring the scss so that I
                could have separate scss files for each theme, as opposed to
                default styles for the components and a dark mode scss file.
              </p>
              <div>
                <h5 class="font-bold">Conclusion:</h5>
                <p>
                  Overall, this was a fun way to learn Firebase and also convert
                  a static frontend to a more dynamic website. That being said,
                  there are still some static components that I kept because I
                  primarily wanted to focus on data for users, products, and
                  orders. I’m pretty happy that I was able to successfully
                  implement all the CRUD operations for these collections, and
                  also build data tables that filtered based on the shared data
                  between the collections (as seen on the edit info page).
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 class="font-bold">What’s Next?:</h5>
                <p>
                  Now that I have more experience with React, as well as some
                  experience with TypeScript and Sass, my next goal is to learn
                  Next.js. The cool thing about learning Next is that it will
                  basically utilize everything I have learned up until now and
                  build on top of it. The thing I am most excited about is the
                  ability to server-side render and generate static websites
                  with basically just React code. So you kind of get the best of
                  both worlds!
